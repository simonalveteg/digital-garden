For the [[Fouriertransformationer\|fourier transform]] of a continuous-time signal to exist the integral must converge, for which sufficient conditions are the dirichlet conditions
1. $x(t)$ has a finite number of finite discontinuities
2. $x(t)$ has a finite number of finite discontinuities
3. $x(t)$ is absolutely integrable

For the discrete-time Foruier transform of a signal to exist, the sum must converge uniformly (at every point) for which a sufficient condition is
> $x(n)$ is absolutely summable $$\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}|x(n)|<\infty$$

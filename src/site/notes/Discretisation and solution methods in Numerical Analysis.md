The process of converting a continuous mathematical model or equation into a discrete form that can be solved numerically on a computer.

- Development
- Analysis
	- Quality (accuracy of discrete solutions)
	- Efficiency (complexity of the solver)
- Practical realisation (implementation)
- Evaluation in practice

From [[Strömtäthet\|current density]] we know that 
$$
\vec{J}=-\rho_e\mu_e\vec{E}=\sigma\vec{E}
$$
where the proportionality constant is defined as [[Conductivity\|conductivity]]. This is Ohm's Law in point form, defined for any point in the metal, which is valid for [[Ohmic Materials\|Ohmic Materials]]. 

Ohm's Law in circuit theory $V=RI$ can be derived from ohm's law in point form.

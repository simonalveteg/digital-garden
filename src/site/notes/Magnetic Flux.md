Magnetic flux is a measure of the strength of a [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] passing through a given area. The magnetic flux through a given area is directly proportional to the strength of the [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] passing through that area. In other words, as the strength of the [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] increases, the magnetic flux through a given area will also increase. This relationship is described by 
$$
\Phi_m=\int_S\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{s}=B\cdot S 
$$
the last step is possible if we have symmetry, and the [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] can be moved out of the integral.

Magnetic flux can be interpreted physically as the circulation of $\vec{A}$ around $C$ equals the total magnetic flux passing through the surface enclosed by the flux.
$$
\Phi_m=\int_S \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{s}=\oint_{C}\vec{A}\cdot d\vec{l} \space \text{ [Wb]}
$$

The magnetic flux can be calculated using [[Vector Magnetic Potential\|Vector Magnetic Potential]] with [[Stoke's Theorem\|Stoke's Theorem]]
$$
\vec{B}=\nabla\times\vec{A} \Rightarrow \Phi_m=\int_S (\nabla\times\vec{A})\cdot d\vec{s}=\oint_{C}\vec{A}\cdot d\vec{l} 
$$

Assuming no leakage flux it can be written
$$
\Phi=\frac{NI\mu S}{l}=\frac{NI}{\left( \frac{l}{\mu S} \right) } = \frac{NI}{\mathcal{R}}
$$

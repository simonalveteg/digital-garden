Magnetomotive force is the property of certain substances or phenomena that give rise to magnetic fields
$$
\mathcal{V_m}=\oint_{C}\vec{H}\cdot d\vec{l}=NI=\Phi_m\mathcal{R}
$$
where $N$ is number of turns, $I$ is the current, $\Phi_m$ is the [[Magnetic Flux\|Magnetic Flux]] and $\mathcal{R}$ is the [[Magnetic Reluctance\|magnetic reluctance]]. [[Hopkinson's Law\|Hopkinson's Law]], [[Ampere's Circuital Law\|Ampere's Law]].

Comparable with [[Electromotive Force\|electromotive force]].

When moving a [[Conductor\|conductor]] through a static [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]]


The [[Conductor\|conductor]] is neutrally charged when it isn't moving. When we start moving the [[Conductor\|conductor]] the force on the charges is given by $\vec{F}=q\vec{u}\times\vec{B}$. In the example below positive charges move upwards and negative charges move down, which induces an [[Electric Field\|electric field]] in the [[Conductor\|conductor]], which gives us an induced [[Potential\|potential]] difference
$$
V_{21}=\int_1^{2}(\vec{u}\times\vec{B})  \cdot, d\vec{l} 
$$

There's a maximum charge separation you can get.

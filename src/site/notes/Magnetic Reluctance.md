Magnetic reluctance, also known as magnetic [[Resistans\|resistance]], is a measure of how difficult it is for a [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] to pass through a material. It is determined by the properties of the material, such as its [[Permeabilitet\|magnetic permeability]], and the geometry of the object, such as its shape and size.

The concept of magnetic reluctance is important in the design of electrical machines, such as motors and generators, where it is used to determine the [[Magnetic Flux\|magnetic flux]] in a [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]]. By minimizing the magnetic reluctance of the materials used in these systems, engineers can improve their efficiency and performance.

The magnetic reluctance of a [[Magnetic Circuits\|magnetic circuit]] is
$$
\mathcal{R}=\frac{l}{\mu S}
$$
where $S$ is the surface area.

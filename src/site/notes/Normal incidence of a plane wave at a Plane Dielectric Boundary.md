When an electromagnetic wave is incident on the surface of a [[Dielectrics\|dielectric]] medium with a different [[Intrinsic Impedance\|intrinsic impedance]], part of the incident power is reflected and part is transmitted, just as when we have an [[Impedans\|impedance]] mismatch in an electric circuit.

The ratios $\frac{E_{r0}}{E_{i0}}$ and $\frac{E_{t0}}{E_{i0}}$ are called reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient. They can be written interms of the intrinsic impedances as
$$
\begin{align}
\Gamma= \frac{E_{r0}}{E_{i0}}=\frac{\eta_{2}-\eta_{1}}{\eta_{2}+\eta_{1}} \\ \\
\tau=\frac{E_{t0}}{E_{i0}}=\frac{2\eta_{2}}{\eta_{2}+\eta_{1}} 
\end{align}
$$
the reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ can be negative or positive whereas the transmission coefficient $\tau$ is always positive.

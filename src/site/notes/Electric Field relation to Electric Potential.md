The difference in [[Electric Potential\|electric potential]] over a field is equal to the line integral along between the two points in question.
$$
V_{1}-V_{2}=-\int\limits_{P_{1}}^{P_{2}} \vec{E} \, dl 
$$
There is a minus sign in front of the integral in order to conform to the convention that in going *against* the [[Electric Field\|electric field]] the [[Electric Potential\|electric potential]] *increases*.

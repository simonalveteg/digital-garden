The Z-plane is used for discrete-time systems and the [[Laplace-planet\|S-plane]] is used for continuous-time systems.
  
The [[Laplace-planet\|s-plane]] is [[Cartesian Coordinates\|Cartesian]] while the z-plane is best thought of as polar.

The frequency response of a continuous time [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]] is the values of the Laplace transform along the imaginary axis. The frequency response of a discrete time [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]] is the values of the [[Z-transform\|z-transform]] along the unit circle.

The unit circle of the Z-plane is the imaginary axis of the [[Laplace-planet\|S-plane]]. 
> the [[Laplace-planet\|s-plane]] is mapped onto the z-plane during a [[Sampling\|sampling]] operation. The mapping is z = e^(sT), where T is the [[Sampling Period\|sampling period]]. This makes it easy to see why the left half of the [[Laplace-planet\|s-plane]] maps to the interior of the unit circle in the z-plane.

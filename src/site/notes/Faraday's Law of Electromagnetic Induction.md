The [[Electromotive Force\|Electromotive Force]] $\mathcal{V}$ induced in a stationary closed circuit is equal to the negative rate of increase of the [[Magnetic Flux\|Magnetic Flux]]:
$$
\mathcal{V}=- \frac{d\Phi}{dt}
$$
where $\mathcal{V}=\oint_{C}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l}$ is the [[Electromotive Force\|emf]] induced in circuit with closed path $C$ and $\Phi=\int_S \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{s}$ is the [[Magnetic Flux\|magnetic flux]] passing through the surface $S$ with boundary $C$. It can be converted to point form using [[Stoke's Theorem\|Stoke's Theorem]].

Faraday's law on point form is one of [[Maxwell's Equations\|Maxwell's Equations]]
$$
\nabla\times\vec{E}=-\frac{ \partial \vec{B} }{ \partial t } 
$$
the right hand side is negative due to [[Lenz' Law of electromagnetic induction\|Lenz' Law of electromagnetic induction]].

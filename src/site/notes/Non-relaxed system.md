A non-relaxed [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]] has some initial conditions, and therefore some content in their delay units when the input [[Signal\|signal]] is applied. Compare with [[Relaxed System\|Relaxed System]]. 

Just as with [[Ensidig Laplacetransform\|one-sided laplace]] for continuous-time [[Linjära och Tidsinvarianta System\|LTI systems]] with initial conditions, there is a [[One-sided Z-transform\|One-sided Z-transform]] for discrete-time [[Linjära och Tidsinvarianta System\|LTI systems]].

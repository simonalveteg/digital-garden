The curl of a [[Vector field\|vector field]] $\vec{A}$ at a point is defined as a [[Vektorer\|vector]] whose *magnitude* is the net circulation of $\vec{A}$ (along closed loop $C$) per unit area (encircled by $C$) tends to zero, and whose *direction* is the normal direction to the area when the area is oriented to make the net circulation maximum.
$$\nabla \times \vec{A}=\lim\limits_{\Delta s \rightarrow0} \frac{1}{\Delta s}\left(\vec{a}_{n} \oint\limits_{C}\vec{A}d \vec{l}\right)$$

Example of curl: A current carrying wire has a [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] that rotates around it ([[Right Hand Rule\|right hand rule]]). The curl for this field is not zero. A point charge on the other hands has [[Electric Flux\|flux lines]] going outwards, the curl for this field is zero.

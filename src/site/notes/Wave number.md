The wave number is a measure of the number of wavelengths that fit into a given distance. 
$$
k=\omega \sqrt{ \mu\epsilon }=\frac{\omega}{c}=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$
where $\omega$ is the frequency of the wave, $\mu$ is the [[Permeabilitet\|permeability]] and $\epsilon$ is the [[Permittivity\|Permittivity]] of the material. Can be used when calculating [[Plane Waves\|Plane Waves]].

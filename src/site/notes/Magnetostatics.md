One can draw many parallells between magnetostatics and [[Electrostatics\|Electrostatics]]. [[Biot-Savart Law\|Biot-Savart Law]] is the equivalent of [[Coulomb's Law\|Coulomb's Law]] for example. [[Steady Electric Currents\|Steady Electric Currents]] can help us understand magnetostatics, since the steady currents cause static magnetic fields.

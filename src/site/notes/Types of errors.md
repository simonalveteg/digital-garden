In numerical analysis a goal is assessin tht eaccuracy of the results of calculations.
- **Noise**: the error in data. THere can also be errors in the mathematical model.
- **Round-off error**: occurs because computers cannot represent all real numbers exactly.
- **Approximation error**: occurs when an exact formula is replaced by another formula that is easier to solve numerically. Also called Truncation Error.

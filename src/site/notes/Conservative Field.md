A conservative field is a [[Vector field\|vector field]] that is the [[Gradient\|gradient]] of some function. It has the property that its line integral is path independent.

The line integral of a closed path in a conservative field is zero
$$
\oint_{C} \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l}=0
$$
or on point form
$$
\nabla\times\vec{E}=0
$$

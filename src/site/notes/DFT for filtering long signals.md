When we use [[Faltning\|convolution]] with long input signals to a [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]], there are a couple of different ways to split the long [[Faltning\|convolution]] into several shorter ones. One of these is the [[Overlap-add Method\|Overlap-add method]].

Focus on turning [[Differentialekvationer\|differential equations]] into two different types of models.

The output is usually whatever we are able to measure. In the [[Example, pendulum swinging\|Example, pendulum swinging]] we have a pendulum on a rod. The input is the [[Torque\|torque]] we can apply to the rod, and the output is the angle.

We want to approximate a nonlinear 1st principle model either with a [[Linear state-space model\|Linear State-space model]] or [[Överföringsfunktion\|transfer function]]. But how do we do that? Both models are linear, but [[Differentialekvationer\|differential equations]] are typically not linear. Therefore we must make some sort of approximation, usually by [[Linearization\|linearising]] our initial set of [[Differentialekvationer\|differential equations]].

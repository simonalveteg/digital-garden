Electromagnetic waves carry [[Energi\|energy]] and as they propagate through space that [[Energi\|energy]] can be transferred to other objects in their path. The Poynting vector is a mathematical concept in physics that describes the flow of energy through a particular area. It is a measure of the energy that is being transported by the electric and magnetic fields at a given point in space, and its direction is the **direction of propagation**.

The induced mangetic field always oppose the applied external field, which reduces the net [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic flux density]]. An induced [[Electromotive Force\|emf]] always gives rise to a current whose [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] opposes the original change in [[Magnetic Flux\|magnetic flux]] “Nature opposes a change in flux”.

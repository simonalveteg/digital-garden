[[Continuous vs Discrete time\|Continuous vs Discrete time]]

How do we sample a continous time signal to a discrete time equivalent
How do we process the discrete input signal to generate the how do we reconstruct the wanted continuous signal

When answering the above questions we need to know what we want to do, what we can do, and how we want to do it.

There are theoretical limits to what we can do. Man förlorar information när man samplar en analog signal. Om man designar sin DSP fel kan systemet bli instabilt.

How we design will implement it’s efficiency, like memory usage, power consumption, more/less flexibility etc. Minimizing the resources used for the processing while fulfilling some processing quality requirement is often an important design goal.

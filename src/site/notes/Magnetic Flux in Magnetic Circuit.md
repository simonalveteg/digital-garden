The [[Magnetic Flux\|magnetic flux]] in a [[Magnetic Circuits\|magnetic circuit]] is given by 
$$
\Phi_m=\frac{NI\mu S}{l}=\frac{NI}{\mathcal{R}}
$$
where $\mu$ is [[Permeabilitet\|magnetic permeability]], $N$ is the number of turns, $I$ is the current, $l$ is the length and $\mathcal{R}$ is [[Magnetic Reluctance\|Magnetic Reluctance]].

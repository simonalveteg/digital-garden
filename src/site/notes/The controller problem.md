The controller problem is when we have a [[Feedback System\|feedback system]] where the [[Setpoint\|setpoint]] value is constant while the load disturbances vary. 

In this case the integrator needs to be in the controller, not the process, otherwise we will still get a [[Stationary Error\|stationary error]].

Is a **closed surface in three-dimensional space** through which the flux of a [[Vector field\|vector field]] is calculated. Gaussian surfaces are usually chosen to exploit symmetries in order to simplify the calculation of the surface integral in [[Gauss' Law\|gauss law]].

If the gaussian surface is chosen such that the **component of the electric field in the normal direction is constant for every point on the surface**, then the calculation will not require difficult integration as the constants can be taken out of the integral.

A filter is something that discriminates between different components of an input and "treat" them differently. We have seen that [[Linjära och Tidsinvarianta System\|LTI systems]] influence different frequency components of an input differently. They are therefore often referred to as filters. 

Pole and zero placements of the [[Z-transform\|z-transform]] influences the magnitude and phase of the [[Discrete-time Fourier transform\|DTFT]]. If the signal we are looking at is the impulse response of an [[Linjära och Tidsinvarianta System\|LTI system]], the pole and zero placement reveals its filter frequency characteristics $H(\omega)$.

Since electrons don't experience free movement through the material, the collisions result in a transfer of energy from work done on the charges to the heat dissipated in the material.

For a volume $dv$ the [[Effekt\|power]] transferred from all [[Laddningsbärare\|charge carriers]] is 
$$
dP=\left( \sum_iP_i \right) dv=\vec{E}\cdot\left( \sum_iN_iq_i\vec{u}_i \right)dv=\vec{E}\cdot\vec{J}dv
$$
$$
\Rightarrow \frac{dP}{dv}=\vec{E}\cdot\vec{J}
$$
which is called power density in point form.

Power density on integral form is given by [[Joule's Law\|Joule's Law]]

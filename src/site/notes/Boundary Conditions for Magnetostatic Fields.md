The normal component of the [[Magnetic Field\|Magnetic Field]] is continuous across a boundary in [[Magnetostatics\|Magnetostatics]], analogous to [[Boundary Conditions for Electrostatic Fields\|Boundary Conditions for Electrostatic Fields]]. 
$$
\vec{B}_{1n}=\vec{B}_{2n}
$$

The tangential component of $\vec{H}$ ([[Magnetic Field Intensity\|Magnetic Field Intensity]]) is discontinuous across the boundary by the amount $J_{ns}$, where a free current exists. But if the [[Conductivity\|conductivity]] $\sigma$ is finite (which it usually is, except for ideal [[Conductor\|conductor]] and superconductor) then there §can be only volume [[Strömtäthet\|current densities]] in the media and $\vec{J}_{s}=0$. The tangential component is therefore continuous across the boundary in most materials:
$$
\vec{H}_{1t}=\vec{H}_{2t}
$$

Can be expressed using the [[Vector Magnetic Potential\|Vector Magnetic Potential]]. The normal component is
$$
\vec{A}_{1n}=\vec{A}_{2n}
$$
and the tangential component is
$$
\vec{A}_{1t}=\vec{A}_{2t}
$$

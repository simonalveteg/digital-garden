Discrete-time systems can be realized using block diagrams. There are a few different types of blocks that are good to know.

## Adder 
Adds two [[Discrete-time signals\|discrete-time signals]] together

## Constant Multiplier
Multiplies a [[Discrete-time signals\|discrete-time signal]] with an integer

## Unit Delay Element
Can be seen as a memory, storing the previous value

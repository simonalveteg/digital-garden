A stationary error is the error that remains if we let the [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]] go on forever. In the first lab we saw that the water level didn't always reach the desired level. The difference is the stationary error. 

The stationary error is determined entirely by the low-frequency properties of the loop [[Överföringsfunktion\|transfer function]] 

$$E(s)=R(s)-Y(s)=\frac{1}{1+G_{0}(s)}R(s)$$
using the [[Final Value Theorem\|Final Value Theorem]] to get the stationary error.

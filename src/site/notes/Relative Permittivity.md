The [[Dielectrics\|dielectric]] constant (deprecated name according to wikipedia..) is a measure of the ability of a material to store electric [[Energi\|energy]] when an [[Electric Field\|electric field]] is applied to it. It is also known as the relative [[Permittivity\|Permittivity]] $\epsilon_r$ of the material. 
$$
\epsilon_r=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}}
$$
where $\epsilon_{0}$ is the [[Permittivity\|permittivity]] of vaccuum.

The [[Dielectrics\|dielectric]] constant is an important property of materials that is used in many applications, such as in the design of capacitors and other electrical components. It is also used in the study of wave propagation in materials, as it determines the velocity and other characteristics of electromagnetic waves in the material.

We start with a *real problem* and describe it as a *physical model*. We can quantify the physical model to a *mathematical model*. We can now choose to either make an analytical solution or a *discrete model*. The discrete model can be but into code which gives us a *computer model*. The computer model can be simulated, the results of which can be evaluated by performing an *experiment* to see if our model is correct. The results give us feedback that we can use to improve our physical model.

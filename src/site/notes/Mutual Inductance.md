Mutual [[Induktans\|inductance]] describes how the [[Induktans\|inductance]] of two circuits affect each other.

Mutual [[Induktans\|inductance]] between two circuits is the [[Magnetic Flux Linkage\|magnetic flux linkage]] with one circuit per unit current in the other circuit:
$$
L_{12}=\frac{\Lambda_{12}}{I_1}
$$
(1 is [[Spole\|coil]] 1 and 12 is how [[Spole\|coil]] 1 affects [[Spole\|coil]] 2?)

It is related to [[Magnetic Flux\|Magnetic Flux]] by
$$
\Phi_{12}=L_{12}I_{1}
$$

If the current is nonzero for both [[Spole\|coils]]:
$$
\begin{align}
\Lambda_1=\Lambda_{11}+\Lambda_{12}=L_{11}I_1+L_{21}I_2 \\
\Lambda_2=\Lambda_{12}+\Lambda_{22}=L_{12}I_1+L_{22}I_2 \\
\end{align}
$$
and it can be shown that $L_{21}=L_{12}$ by reciprocity. Can be useful since one of them might be easier to solve than the other.

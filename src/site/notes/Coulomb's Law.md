The magnitude of electric force between two point charges is directly porportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
$$\begin{flalign}&|\vec{F}| \propto q_{1}q_{2} \\&|\vec{F}|\propto \frac{1}{R^{2}} \end{flalign}$$
which gives $|\vec{F}|=k_{c} \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{R^{2}}$ where $k_{c}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}$.

If there are more than two point charges we can calculate the forces on the charges using the principle of [[Superposition\|Superposition]]. With $n$ charges the force on charge $q_{m}$ is $$\vec{F}_{m}=\frac{q_{m}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}\sum\limits_{\begin{flalign}k=1 \\k\neq m \end{flalign}}^{n} \frac{q_{k}}{R_{km}^{2}}a_{R_{km}}$$

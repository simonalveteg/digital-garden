The [[Magnetic Force on a current carrying circuit\|Magnetic Force on a current carrying circuit]] can be calculated using Ampere's Force Law! If we have two independent circuits, the force on $C_{1}$ due to field from $C_{2}$ is given by
$$
\vec{F}_{21}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{1}I_{2}}{4\pi}\oint_{C_{1}}\oint_{C_{2}} \frac{d\vec{l}_1\times(d\vec{l}_2\times\vec{a}_R)}{R_{21}^{2}} =I_{1}\oint_{C_1} d\vec{l}\times\vec{B}_{2}
$$


Two infinitely long wires with current flowing in the same direction experience forces of attraction.

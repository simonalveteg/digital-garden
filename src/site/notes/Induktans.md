The ability to oppose a change in current. Electrical inertia.


In [[Magnetostatics\|Magnetostatics]] we relate the current to the [[Magnetic Flux\|Magnetic Flux]] for current carrying circuits. How much current we get depends on the **inductance**. 

> Inductance defines the [[Magnetic Flux\|flux]]-carrying capability of a current carrying circuit.


$$u_L=L \frac{di_L}{dt}$$
$$
i_L= \frac{1}{L}\int u_L
$$

Machine epsilon denoted $\epsilon_{mach}$ is the distance between 1 and the smallest floating point number greater than 1.

Machine epsilon $\epsilon_{mach}$ is the smallest number that can be represented by a computer system in [[Floating-point representation\|floating-point arithmetic]]. In other words it represents the maximum amount of error that can occur when representing a real number in a computer due to limitations in the precision of the arithmetic operations performed by the computer.

Machine epsilon is determined by the number of its used to represent the matnissa or significand of a floating-point number, as well as the exponent range. Smaller number of bits â†’ larger $\epsilon_\text{mach}$.

Self-[[Induktans\|inductance]] is given by the flux divided by the current that generates the flux (for one turn)
$$
L_{11}=\frac{\Phi_{11}}{I_{1}}
$$
If there are more than one turn we instead have
$$
L_{11}=\frac{\Lambda_{11}}{I_{1}}
$$
where $\Lambda$ is [[Magnetic Flux Linkage\|Magnetic Flux Linkage]]

If you need to find the correct [[Charge Distribution\|charge distribution]] that results in a certain [[Electric Field\|electric field]] there are a few things you can keep in mind.

1. How does the field radiate outward?
2. How does the field decay with distance?
	A point charge decays with $\frac{1}{R^{2}}$, an infinite line charge with $\frac{1}{R}$, and an infinite plane doesn't decay. An [[Electric Dipole\|electric dipole]] decays with $\frac{1}{R^{3}}$

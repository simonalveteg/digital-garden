Often times [[Stabila och Instabila System\|stability]] is not enough. Robustness is a measure of how close the [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]] is to becoming unstable.

[[Stabila och Instabila System\|Stability]] doesn't really tell you very much. Something can be [[Stabila och Instabila System\|stable]] and still perform really badly.

Two graphical analysis methods are the [[Nyquist Stability Criteria\|Nyquist Stability Criteria]] and [[Rotort\|root locus]]

Ideally we want the robustness margins to be big. If the margins are small errors can make the system become unstable. In the [[Nyquist plot\|Nyquist plot]] the [[Nyquist Stability Criteria\|Nyquist Stability Criteria]] can be used to see how robust the system is. The further to the left of the curve the point is the more robust it is â€” since the error signals need to be much larger for the signal (visualized by the curve) to fall to the left of the point.

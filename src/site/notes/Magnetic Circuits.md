Instead of a voltage source or current source, magnetic circuits rely on current loops (with $N$ turns) as the source, where we can define a [[Magnetomotive Force\|Magnetomotive Force]]. 

To simplify calculations we make the following assumptions
1. No leakage flux in the magnetic circuit
2. [[Ferromagnetism\|Ferromagnetic material]] used in the circuit is linear ($\mu$ can be defined)
This implies that the [[Magnetic Field Intensity\|Magnetic Field Intensity]] $\vec{H}$ (and the [[Magnetic Flux\|Magnetic Flux]] $\vec{B}$) generated by the current loop will be confined fully in the circuit.

An air gap in the ferromagnetic material introduce [[Magnetic Reluctance\|Magnetic Reluctance]] and is analogous to a [[Resistans\|resistance]]. We can also apply [[Kirchoff's Current Law\|Kirchoff's Current Law]] and [[Kirchoff's Voltage Law\|Kirchoff's Voltage Law]].

[[Magnetic Flux\|Magnetic Flux]] <–> Current
[[Magnetomotive Force\|Magnetomotive Force]] <–> Voltage

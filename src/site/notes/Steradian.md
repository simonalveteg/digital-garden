Steradian or square radian is the unit of solid angle used in three-dimensional geometry. It is analogous to the radian. An angle in radians projected onto a circle gives a length on the circumference, but a solid angle in steradians projected onto a sphere gives an area on the surface.

$$
\Omega=\frac{S}{r^2}
$$
If the surface covers the entire sphere then the number of steradians is $4\pi$.

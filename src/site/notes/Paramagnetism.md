Paramagnetic materials produce a [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] that supports the applied [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] (para = support). 

The spinning and orbital motions of all electrons are oriented in such a way that there is a net [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]]. This allows the atoms and molecolues of these materials to align themselves to the applied external [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]]. This alignment *increases* the net [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic flux density]] $\vec{B}$. The alignment is limited by thermal vibrations (and is therefore temperature dependent). The impact on the external field is mostly weak.

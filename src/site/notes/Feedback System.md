A [[feedback\|feedback]] [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]] consists of [[feedback\|feedback]] and feedforward. The image below shows an example of a very simple [[feedback\|feedback]] [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]].

e is the error signal which we want to get as close to zero as possible.
n is noise that affects our [[Sensor and Transducer\|sensor]] input
d is disturbance (added after [[Control System\|control system]])
r is what you want to happen and y is what actually happens

For a [[feedback\|feedback]] [[System (matematisk definition)\|System (matematisk definition)]] like this the [[Transfer function from block diagram\|transfer function can easily be found]].

The purpose of the [[Control System\|control system]] is to turn the error signal into our control action.

The blocks can also be named by their corresponding [[Överföringsfunktion\|transfer functions]], $P(s)$ for the process and $C(s)$ for the [[Control System\|control system]].

Logarithmic scale of the amplitude and phase as functions of the frequency $\omega$. 

A bode plot is a graphical representation of how an input-output relation behaves at different frequencies $\omega$.

A [[Överföringsfunktion\|transfer function]] of a higher order can be divided into several lower order [[Överföringsfunktion\|transfer functions]] (typfunktioner), which can then be used to draw the bode diagram.

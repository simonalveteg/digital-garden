When the [[Electric Field\|electric field]] oscillates in a fixed direction, we call the [[Plane Waves\|plane wave]] linearly [[Polarization\|polarized]] in that direction. When a planar wave is said to be "[[Polarization\|polarized]]," it means that the [[Electric Field\|electric field]] within the wave is oscillating in a specific direction, rather than randomly in all directions.

[[Polarization\|Polarization]] is important because it determines how the wave will interact with other objects. For example, when light waves are [[Polarization\|polarized]], they can pass through certain materials that would normally block them, such as Polaroid sunglasses. [[Polarization\|Polarization]] is also used in many types of communication and measurement systems, such as radar and radio antennae.

There are two main types of [[Polarization\|polarization]]: linear polarization and circular polarization. In linear polarization, the [[Electric Field\|electric field]] oscillates in a single direction, such as up and down or side to side. In circular polarization, the [[Electric Field\|electric field]] rotates in a circular pattern as the wave propagates.

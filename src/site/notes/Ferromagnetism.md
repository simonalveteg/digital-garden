Ferromagnetic materials contain iron or have the same properties as iron. They act to increase the net [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic flux density]], as in [[Paramagnetism\|Paramagnetism]], but the effect is orders of magnitude stronger.

Ferromagnetism can be explained in terms of "magnetized domains", that are regions of prealigned magnetic dipoles, separated by domain walls. In the absence of external [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] there is no net [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]].

When an external [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] is applied the domain walls move to enlarge the domains that are magnetized in the diretion of the external field.

When the external field exceeds a certain level, the movement of the domain walls are not reversible, which results in the material becoming a permanent magnet.

How do [[Dielectrics\|Dielectrics]] behave in static [[Electric Field\|electric fields]]?

Three situations can occur
1. An external field $\vec{E}_{0}$ can cause the positive and negative charges to be displaced in opposite directions $\Rightarrow$ induced [[Electric Dipole\|electric dipoles]] by "stretching" the atom.
2. Some [[Dielectrics\|dielectrics]] have permanent [[Electric Dipole\|electric dipole]] behavior even without any external field $\Rightarrow$ polar molecules, e.g. $H_{2}O$ molecules. These molecules are not aligned to one another in general. However, an external field will cause a polar molecule to align itself with the field.
3. Some [[Dielectrics\|dielectric]] materials ("electrets") consist of polar molecules that are permanently aligned with one another to induce an elctric field $\vec{E}_{1}$, even without any external field ([[Polarization\|polarized]] on a macroscopic level) $\Rightarrow$ electrical equivalent of permanent magnets.

These atoms/molecules are [[Polarization\|polarized]] when they exhibit dipole behavior, causing an induced field.

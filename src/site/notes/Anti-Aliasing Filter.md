An anti-aliasing filter is a filter used before a signal sampler to restrict the [[Bandbredd\|bandwidth]] of the signal in order to satisfy the [[Nyquists Samplingskriterium\|nyquist sampling theorem]] over the band of interest. The frequency components that are outside the [[Bandbredd\|bandwidth]] would otherwise lead to [[Aliasing\|Aliasing]], which we do not want.

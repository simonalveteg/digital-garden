I det komplexa talplanet ritar man ut nyquistkurvor.
example:

Every point of the nyquist plot corresponds to an evaluation of the [[Överföringsfunktion\|Transfer Function]]. The distance from origo is the absolute value of the gain. The nyquist curve is a continuous curve with a direction. 

A nyquist plot and a bode plot both plot the same thing.

The *unit circle* has the magnitude 1, which means that the corner frequency is at the point where the nyquist curve crosses the unit circle.

The shortest distance to the point -1 can be found in the step response by looking at the gain $A$ at the highest point, $\frac{1}{A}$.

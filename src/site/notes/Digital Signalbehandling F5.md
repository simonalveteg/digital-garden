# Related signals
A signal can be either periodic or aperiodic. Even if the continuous-time signal is periodic the sampled [[Discrete-time signals\|discrete-time signal]] is not guaranteed to be so as well. Most real world signals are aperiodic.

Periodic signals are easier to analyze since they can be described by [[Fourierserier\|Fourier Series]].

The fundamental period $T_{P}$ is the smallest period you can add to get the same value for a periodic signal.

The circulation of the [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic flux density]] in vacuum around any closed loop $C$ is equal to $\mu_{0}$ times the total current flowing through the surface bounded by the path. On **integral form**:
$$\oint\limits_{C}\vec{B}\cdot d \vec{l}=\mu_{0}\int \vec{J}\cdot d\vec{s} =\mu_{0}I$$
where $\vec{B}$ is [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] intensity, $\mu_{0}$ is the [[Permeabilitet\|magnetic permeability]] in free space and $I$ is the total current enclosed by $C$. The equation can be simplified to 
$$
BL=\mu_{0}I_{\text{enclosed}}
$$
if we have an [[Amperian Loop\|Amperian Loop]]. 

> You can only use Ampere's Circuital Law if you know the entire circuit, since there must be symmetry! Do not use it if you only know about a section of the circuit.

It can also be written on **point form**
$$\huge\nabla \times \vec{B} = \vec{J}$$
where $\vec{J}$ is the volume [[Strömtäthet\|current density]].

The [[Magnetic Reluctance\|Magnetic Reluctance]] of a [[Magnetic Circuits\|magnetic circuit]] is not that hard to calculate, [[Magnetic Circuits vs Electric Circuits\|since it is analogous to electric circuits]]. If we have a circuit like this one:

we can simplify it to

which makes it obvious that we have one resistor in series with two that are in parallel. Now we just calculate the reluctance of each part of the circuit and add them together in the correct way.

## 1. Calculate reluctances
[[Magnetic Reluctance\|Magnetic Reluctance]] is calculated using $\mathcal{R}=\frac{l}{\mu S}$, where $l$ is the median length of that part of the circuit, i.e the length through the middle. $\mathcal{R}_1$ would have a length of $3(b+a)$ for example. In this case the area is the same for all parts ($a^{2}$), and so is the [[Permeabilitet\|permeability]] $\mu$.

## 2. Calculate total reluctance
This is done in the exact same way as for resistances in an electric circuit. See [[Serie- och paralell-kopplingar\|Serie- och paralell-kopplingar]].

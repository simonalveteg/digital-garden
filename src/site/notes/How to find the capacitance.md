How do we find the [[Kapacitans\|capacitance]]? We can calculate the [[Electric Potential\|electric potential]] between the plates using the [[Electric Field\|electric field]], which we often can get using [[Gauss' Law\|gauss law]] (easy if there is symmetry).

The [[Kapacitans\|capacitance]] is given by $C=\frac{Q}{V}$. Both the [[Potential\|potential]] and the charge relates to the [[Electric Field\|electric field]]. The charge relates by [[Gauss' Law\|Gauss' Law]].

## 1. Choose a [[Coordinate Systems\|coordinate system]]
Choose the [[Coordinate Systems\|coordinate systems]] that makes the most sense for the given geometry. This should be straight forward, sphere → [[Spherical Coordinates\|spherical coordinates]], cylinder → [[Cylindrical Coordinates\|cylindrical coordinates]] and so on.

## 2. Assume the charge on the [[Conductor\|conductors]]
Assume that the charge is $+Q$ on one of the [[Conductor\|conductors]] and $-Q$ on the other. 

## 3. Find the [[Electric Field\|electric field]]
Using [[Gauss' Law\|Gauss' Law]] we can get an expression of the [[Electric Field\|electric field]] that depends on the charge $Q$. Remember that the [[Electric Field\|electric field]] goes from positive charge to negative charge, so depending on how you choose the charge the direction of the elctric field changes.

## 4. Find the [[Potential\|potential]]
The [[Potential\|potential]] is given by
$$V_{12}=\int\limits_{-Q \rightarrow+Q}-\vec{E}\cdot d \vec{l}$$
the negative integral from the negative charge to the positive charge! 

## 5. Find the [[Kapacitans\|capacitance]]
Now you can plug in the expressions into 
$$C= \frac{Q}{V_{12}}$$
to get the [[Kapacitans\|capacitance]]!

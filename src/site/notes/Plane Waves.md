Plane waves are a simplified form of [[Transverse Electromagnetic Waves\|Transverse Electromagnetic Waves]], where we assume that fields only vary in the direction of propagation. We use plane waves as a tool to make derivations easy. We often discuss electromagnetic wave properties and derive electromagnetic laws in terms of plane waves, even though they are simplified idealizations of EM waves.

> A plane wave's magntiude, phase and orientation must depend only on the variable(s) associated with the direction of propagation.

$$
\left| \vec{E}_0 \right| = \eta_{0}\left| \vec{H}_0 \right| $$
where $\eta$ is the [[Intrinsic impedance in free space\|Intrinsic impedance in free space]], or generally
$$
\begin{align}
\vec{E}&=-\eta\vec{a}_k\times\vec{H} \\
\vec{H}&=\frac{1}{\eta}\vec{a}_k\times\vec{E}
\end{align}
$$
where $\vec{a}_k$ is the unit vector in the direction of propagation. To use this expression we need to have the fields in [[Phasors\|phasor]] form, since the [[Intrinsic Impedance\|Intrinsic Impedance]] is a complex quantity and should not be mixed with real time functions of fields.

A plane wave propagates through a medium in a uniform and unchanging manner, with all points on the wavefront having the same amplitude and phase. The shape of the wave does not change as it travels through the medium, and the wave maintains its original form over time. 

When an electromagnetic wave travelling in one medium impinges on another medium with a different [[Intrinsic Impedance\|intrinsic impedance]], it experiences a reflection.

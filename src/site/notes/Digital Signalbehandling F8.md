If you have a pole on the unit circle you basically get a resonator (that never stops ringing).

[[Poles and zeros of Z-transforms\|Poles and zeros of Z-transforms]]

By placing poles and zeros in the z-domain, we can design filters with some desired frequency response $H(\omega)$.

If the poles are not in zero we have an [[IIR Filter\|IIR Filter]].

Steep [[Linear phase\|linear phase]] curves means more delay.

# Electronics
Everything in series with a current source can be removed, the state of every component is described by the voltage and the current. If we have a current source in series with a couple of resistors and want to know the state of one of the resistors, then the other resistors are redundant.

Om man tar bort en [[Källor (elektronik)\|strömkälla]] blir det ett avbrott, tar man bort en [[Källor (elektronik)\|spänningskälla]] blir det en kortslutning. 

Everything in parallell with a voltage source can be removed.

A component is redundant if it serves no purpose. It can still impact the circuit negatively and lead to a 

In the real world you might want to add redundancy to make sure that the circuit still works even if some component fails.

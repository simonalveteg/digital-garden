Charges that move at a steady pace.

There are three types of motion for these currents
1. Conduction: drift motion of conduction electrons or holes from applied [[Electric Field\|electric field]].
2. Electrolytic: migration of positive and negative ions.
3. Convection: motion of electrons or ions in vacuum.

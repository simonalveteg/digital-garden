[[Electric Dipole\|Electric dipoles]] can be polarized when an external [[Electric Field\|electric field]] is applied, which aligns all the dipoles in the same direction. The [[Electric Dipole Moment\|Electric Dipole Moment]] is defined for a single dipole, but in a volume $\Delta v$ of a [[Dielectrics\|dielectric material]] with $n$ induced dipoles $\vec{p}_k$ per unit volume we can define the **polarization vector** as
$$\vec{P}\stackrel{\Delta}{=} \frac{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n \Delta v}\vec{p}_{k}}{\Delta v}$$
which can be thought of as the volume density of the [[Electric Dipole Moment\|electric dipole moment]]. It quantifies the extent to which the [[Dielectrics\|dielectric material]] is polarized.
$$
\vec{P}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dv}

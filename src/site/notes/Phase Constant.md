The phase constant $\beta$ is a quantity that describes the phase of a wave, and has units of radians per unit length. The phase constant is related to the [[Wave number\|Wave number]] by 
$$
\beta=2\pi k
$$
this relationship arises because the phase of a wave is determined by the number of complete wavelengths that fit into a given distance, which the wave number is a measure of.

Electric charges cannot be created or destroyed (conservation of charges). If we have a volume $V$ bounded by a surface $S$ with a total charge of $Q$ the equation of continuity in point form is 
$$
\nabla\cdot\vec{J}=- \frac{ \partial \rho }{ \partial t } 
$$
where $\vec{J}$ is the [[Strömtäthet\|current density]] and $\rho$ is the [[Charge Density\|Charge Density]].

A point charge cannot keep it's charge forever. The [[Divergence\|divergence]] of the [[Strömtäthet\|current density]] is equal to the decay of the [[Charge Density\|charge density]].

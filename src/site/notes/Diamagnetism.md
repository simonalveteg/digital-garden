Diamagnetic materials produce a [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] that is opposite to the applied [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]]. (dia = opposite). It is present in all materials, but is weak in most cases.

The spinning and orbital motions of all electrons are randomly oriented in the absence of an external [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]], which means that the [[Magnetic Dipole Moment\|magnetic dipole moments]] add up to zero, i.e no induced field.

When an external field is applied the electrons experience a [[Magnetic Force\|Magnetic Force]] $\vec{F_m}=q\vec{u}\times\vec{B}$ causing the angular velocities to vary. [[Lenz' Law of electromagnetic induction\|Lenz' Law of electromagnetic induction]] tells us that the induced mangetic field always oppose the applied external field, which reduces the net [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic flux density]] $\vec{B}$. It is similar to what we see in the response of [[Dielectrics in Static Electric Field\|Dielectrics in Static Electric Field]], where the induced field is opposite and equal to the applied field.

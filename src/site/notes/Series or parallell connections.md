The following image is of a cylindrical [[Kapacitans\|capacitor]] with four different media between its plates. In this case you need to perform the steps above four times, one per medium. The total [[Kapacitans\|capacitance]] is all four capacitances in parallell.

Remember parallelity by thinking about a wall with a window. The window is in parallel with the wall, since you can choose to pass through either the wall or the window. If you had to pass through both they would be in series. Same applies to capacitances and resistances.

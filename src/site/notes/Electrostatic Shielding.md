Electrostatic shielding is a technique for reducing capactive coupling between conducting bodies. If we have a grounding conducting shell enclosing a conducting body, and a second conducting body outside, a change in potential of the different bodies won't affect eachohter, since the grounding shell holds one of the bodies at zero potential.

The dipole moment decides the strength of the [[Electric Dipole\|electric dipole]]
$$
\vec{p}=q\vec{d}
$$
where $q$ is the charge (one of the sources in the dipole having a positive q and the other a negative q) and $\vec{d}$ is the distance between the charges.

the [[Electric Field for point dipoles\|Electric Field for point dipoles]] is proportional to the dipole moment.

> The direction is from $-q$ to $+q$.

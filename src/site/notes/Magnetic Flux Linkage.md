Magnetic$\,\,$flux linkage is the measure of the total number of [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] lines that pass through a given surface or circuit (often due to another circuit). In other words, it is a measure of the strength of the [[Magnetic Field\|magnetic field]] around a circuit. It is given by
$$
\Lambda_{12}=N_2\Phi_{12}=L_{12}I_{1}
$$
where $N$ is the number of turns, $\Phi$ is [[Magnetic Flux\|Magnetic Flux]], $I$ is current and $L$ is [[Induktans\|inductance]].

$$
\Phi=\int \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{s} 
$$
